                <h3>The Missile Knows Where It Is</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By
                subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater),
                it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective
                commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't and arriving at a
                position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is is now the position that it
                wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was is now the position that it isn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired
                a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is and where it wasn't. If the
                variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the
                missile must also know where it was.
            </p>
            <p>
                The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows: because a variation has modified some of the
                information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it
                isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it
                wasn't, or vice-versa. And by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be and
                where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and variation, which is called error.

            <header><h3>Summary</h3></header>
            <p>
                In summary, “The missile knows where it is because it knows where it isn't.”
            </p>
            <p>
                In laymen's terms, the missile gets the coordinates of where it was launched and most likely knows where 
                its destination is. The missile knows its speed and direction. It knows that it has travelled a distance 
                from where it was launched. So it knows where it is based on where it isn't (the launch point).
