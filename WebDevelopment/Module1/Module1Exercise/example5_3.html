  <h1>An excerpt from "Wild Wool"</h1>
  <h2>By John Muir</h2>
  <p>
    No dogma taught by the present civilization seems to form so insuperable an obstacle in the way of a 
    right understanding of the relations which culture sustains to wildness as that which regards the world 
    as made especially for the uses of man. Every animal, plant, and crystal controverts it in the plainest 
    terms. Yet it is taught from century to century as something ever new and precious, and in the resulting 
    darkness the enormous conceit is allowed to go unchallenged.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have never yet happened upon a trace of evidence that seemed to show that any one animal was ever 
    made for another as much as it was made for itself. Not that Nature manifests any such thing as selfish 
    isolation. In the making of every animal the presence of every other animal has been recognized. Indeed, 
    every atom in creation may be said to be acquainted with and married to every other, but with universal 
    union there is a division sufficient in degree for the purposes of the most intense individuality; no 
    matter, therefore, what may be the note which any creature forms in the song of existence, it is made 
    first for itself, then more and more remotely for all the world and worlds.
