      My name is Christian Blythe but I go by Andrew, my middle name. I am 21 years old as of December 31st, and 
      I am studying to be a coder/programmer at Pearl River Community College in Forest County, Mississippi. 
      I work semi-regularly for my father at his mechanic shop. I work on various gas-powered automobiles, 
      doing anything from brakes to replacing a radiator or alternator. I also work on my car, sometimes for 
      fun, sometimes out of necessity. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a few different activities I like to do in my free time. Video games are one thing, taking up a 
      notable portion of my free time. My most played games currently are Rocket League (a car soccer game), 
      Minecraft (open-world building and exploration), and The Forest (a wilderness survival horror game). 
      There's also Call of Duty Black Ops 3 Zombies, anything from the Grand Theft Auto series, and Need for 
      Speed that I will play sometimes.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, there's the stock market. I began learning about and investing in the stock market back in 
      September of 2020, buying fractional shares in companies like 3M, Southwest Airlines, Tesla, and 
      Exxon Mobil. At first, I was putting up tiny amounts of money into companies I knew a bit about. 
      Since then, I've come a long way, having learned much of the verbiage, research requirements, and 
      risks. Now, I spend most of the time reading up on the news about companies/stocks I watch, keeping 
      up with current events that could potentially affect the market. I also look at charts and past 
      performance of stocks I am interested in, but I try not to spend too much time getting caught up in the 
      day-to-day ups and downs. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am somewhat of a car enthusiast, probably due to growing up around them at my father's shop. Because 
      of this, I enjoy working on my car, watching TV shows like Top Gear and The Grand Tour, and reading 
      about or watching content about cars, vehicles, and general mechanical-related things. I view many cars 
      as pieces of art. One day, after making some substantial money from a programming job (I hope), I will 
      be able to afford some pretty neat cars, including any one of these: 2011 Lexus ISF, Lexus GSF, 2018 
      or '19 Bentley Continental GT, Mercury Marauder, Ferrari 458, Ferrari 488. There are many more cars 
      I'd love to have, too many to list here, but these listed have the front row seats of my wish list.
