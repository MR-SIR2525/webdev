    <p>
      My name is Christian Blythe but I go by Andrew, my middle name. I am 21 years old as of December 31st, and
      I am studying to be a coder/programmer at Pearl River Community College in Forest County, Mississippi.
      I work semi-regularly for my father at his mechanic shop on various gas-powered automobiles,
      doing anything from brakes to replacing a radiator or alternator. I also work on my car, sometimes for
      fun, sometimes out of necessity. Generally, I am a reserved and quiet person who values honesty and a
      do-it-yourself mentality.

      <h3>Video Games</h3>
    </Header>
    <p>
      I have a few different activities I like to do in my free time. Video games are one thing, taking up a
      notable portion of my free time. My most played games currently are Rocket League (a car soccer game),
      Minecraft (open-world building and exploration), and The Forest (a wilderness survival horror game).
      There's also Call of Duty Black Ops 3 Zombies, anything from the Grand Theft Auto series, and Need for
      Speed that I will play sometimes.

        <h3>Stock Market</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        Then, there's the stock market. I began learning about and investing in the stock market back in
        September of 2020, buying fractional shares in companies like 3M, Southwest Airlines, Tesla, and
        Exxon Mobil. At first, I was putting up tiny amounts of money into companies I knew a bit about.
        Since then, I've come a long way, having learned much of the verbiage, research requirements, and
        risks. Now, I spend most of the time reading up on the news about companies/stocks I watch, keeping
        up with current events that could potentially affect the market. I also look at charts and past
        performance of stocks I am interested in, but I try not to spend too much time getting caught up in the
        day-to-day ups and downs. Overall, my goal is to use the stock market to accumulate some wealth over the long
        term.

        <h3>Cars</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        To say that I am a car enthusiast would be accurate. I credit this to growing up around cars at my father's
        shop. Because of this, I enjoy working on my car, watching TV shows like Top Gear and The Grand Tour, and
        reading about or watching content about cars, vehicles, and general mechanical-related things. I view
        many cars as pieces of art. One day, after making some substantial money from a programming job (I hope),
        I will be able to afford some pretty neat cars, including any one of these: 2011 Lexus ISF, Lexus GSF, 2018
        or '19 Bentley Continental GT, Mercury Marauder, Ferrari 458, Ferrari 488. There are many more cars
        I'd love to have, too many to list here, but these above have the front row seats of my wish list.
