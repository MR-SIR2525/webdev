      NATO outlines 'deterrence' plan as tensions with Russia soar
    </h3>
    <p>
      <span class="boldWord">BRUSSELS (AP)</span>  — Tensions soared Monday between Russia and the
      West over concerns that Moscow is planning to invade Ukraine, with NATO outlining potential troop and ship

      to join and that other actions, such as stationing alliance troops in former Soviet bloc countries, be curtailed.
